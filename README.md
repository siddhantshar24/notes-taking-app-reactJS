# ReactJS-Notes-taking-Application
ReactJS Project for Notes taking application built using CRUD (Create Retrieve Update Delete) applications implemented in ReactJS framework.

Technologies used: ReactJS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

Description about technologies used:
ReactJS is used for making a project that includes basic CRUD operations, i.e. GET, POST, DELETE and UPDATE for a Note making application. 
The application is used for Storing information of Todo tasks using these CRUD methods.

To start the project in your local, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


Use the UI page to save all the information that is required to be saved. The section is divided into two parts; i.e. on the left, an overview of collection of all the notes present and on the right it contains information regarding a particular note selected from the list. The notes could be deleted, added, retrieved and updated from the UI itself and also has a option to save the notes locally.
